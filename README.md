# unix-exec-output-catcher
A library written in Rust that executes an executable in a child process and catches its output (stdout and stderr).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Difference to std::process::Command üö®
`std::process::Command` does the same in the standard library but **with one exception**:
My library gives you access to stdout, stderr, **and "stdcombined"**. This way you get all output
lines in the order they appeared. That's the unique feature of this crate.
[std/process/struct.Command.html#method.output](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.output)

## TL;DR;
The call to `fork_exec_and_catch()` is blocking. If the program produces infinite output to
stdout or stderr, this function will never return. If the program produces 1GB of output
this function will consume 1GB of memory. See examples directory for example code.

## Example
```
use unix_exec_output_catcher::fork_exec_and_catch;

fn main() {
    // executes "ls" with "-la" as argument.
    // this is equivalent to running "$ ls -la" in your shell.
    // The line by line output is stored inside the result.
    let res = fork_exec_and_catch("ls", vec!["ls", "-la"]);
    println!("{:#?}", res.unwrap());
}
```
